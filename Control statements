Control statements

Type	            Statement	              Purpose
Conditional	      if, elif, else	        Decision making
Looping	          for, while	            Repetition
Jump	            break, continue, pass	  Modify loop flow
Pattern Matching	match-case	            Structured decision making

🧠 Summary
Loop Type	        When to Use	                                                  Example
for loop	        When you know how many times to repeat	                      for i in range(10):
while loop	      When you don’t know how many times; depends on a condition	  while x < 5:

🌀 1. for Loop

Used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, string, or range).
Example 1: Looping through a list
      fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
      for fruit in fruits:
          print(fruit)
       
      Output:
      apple
      banana
      cherry

Example 2: Using range()
      for i in range(5):
          print(i)
      Output:
      0
      1
      2
      3
      4

🔁 2. while Loop : Executes a block of code as long as a condition is true.

Example:
      count = 1
      while count <= 5:
          print("Count is:", count)
          count += 1
      Output:
      
      Count is: 1
      Count is: 2
      Count is: 3
      Count is: 4
      Count is: 5

🧩 Loop Control Statements

Used to control the flow of loops.

Statement	              Description
break	                  Exits the loop completely
continue	              Skips the current iteration and goes to the next
pass	                  Does nothing (used as a placeholder)

Example of break:
      for i in range(10):
          if i == 5:
              break
          print(i)
      Output:
      0 1 2 3 4

Example of continue:
      for i in range(5):
          if i == 2:
              continue
          print(i)
      Output:
      0 1 3 4

Example of pass:
      for i in range(5):
          if i == 3:
              pass  # placeholder for future code
          print(i)
      Output:
      0 1 2 3 4
